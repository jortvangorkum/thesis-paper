\begin{minted}{haskell}
data Tree a = Leaf a
            | Node (Leaf a) a (Leaf a)
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{haskell}
sumTree :: Tree Int -> Int
sumTree (Leaf x)     = x
sumTree (Node l x r) = x + (sumTree l) + (sumTree r)
\end{minted}

Computing a value of a data structure can easily be defined in Haskell, but every time there is a small change in the \texttt{Tree}, the entire \texttt{Tree} needs to be recomputed. This is inefficient, because most of the computations have already been performed in the previous computation. 

To prevent recomputation of already computed values, the technique memoization is introduced. Memoization is a technique where the results of computational intensive tasks are stored and when the same input occurs, the result is reused. 

\todo[inline]{Write about the bad side of using hashes}

The comparison of two values in Haskell is done with the \texttt{Eq} typeclass, which implements the equality operator \inlinehaskell{(==) :: a -> a -> Bool}. So, an example implementation of the \texttt{Eq} typeclass for the \texttt{Tree} datatype would be:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
instance Eq a => Eq (Tree a) where
    Leaf x1       == Leaf x2       = x1 == x2
    Node l1 x1 r1 == Node l2 x2 r2 = x1 == x2 && l1 == l2 && r1 == r2
    _             == _             = False
\end{minted}

The problem with using this implementation of the \texttt{Eq} typeclass for Memoization is that for every comparison of the \texttt{Tree} datatype the equality is computed. This is inefficient because the equality implementation has to traverse the complete \texttt{Tree} data structure to know if the \texttt{Tree}'s are equal. 

To efficiently compare the \texttt{Tree} datatypes, we need to represent the structure in a manner which does not lead to traversing to the complete \texttt{Tree} data structure. This can be accomplished using a \texttt{hash} function. A hash function is a process of transforming a data structure into an arbitrary fixed-size value, where the same input always generates the same output. One of the disadvantages of using hashes is \textit{hash collisions}. Hash collisions happen when two different pieces of data have the same hash. This is because a hash function has a limited amount of bits to represent every possible combination of data. However, common hash functions have such a low chance of getting a hash collision it is negligible. %\footnote{A hash function has a $50\%$ chance of a hash collision occurring with records of size $1.2 \times 2^(L/2)$ where $L$ is the amount of bits. For example, the MD5 hash function needs }

\begin{minted}{haskell}
class Hashable a where
    hash :: a -> Hash

instance Hashable a => Hashable (Tree a) where
    hash (Leaf x)     = concatHash [hash "Leaf", hash x]
    hash (Node l x r) = concatHash [hash "Node", hash x, hash l, hash r]
\end{minted}

The hashes can then be used to efficiently compare two \texttt{Tree} data structures, without having to traverse the entire \texttt{Tree} data structure. To keep track of the intermediate results of the computation, we store the results in a \texttt{Map}. A \texttt{Map}, also known as a dictionary, is an implementation of mapping a key to a value. In our next example the \texttt{Hash} is the key and the value is the intermediate result.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
sumTreeInc :: Tree Int -> (Int, Map Hash Int)
sumTreeInc l@(Leaf x)     = (x, insert (hash l) x empty)
sumTreeInc n@(Node l x r) = (y, insert (hash n) y (ml <> mr))
    where
        y = x + xl + xr
        (xl, ml) = sumTreeInc l
        (xr, mr) = sumTreeInc r
\end{minted}

\todo[inline]{Write about the reuse of the Map}

\todo[inline]{Maybe add the more efficient implementation of merging maps?}
\begin{minted}{haskell}
sumTreeIncMap :: Map Hash Int -> Tree Int -> (Int, Map Hash Int)
sumTreeIncMap m l@(Leaf x) = case lookup (hash l) m of
    Just x  -> (x, m) 
    Nothing -> (x, insert (hash l) x empty)
sumTreeIncMap m n@(Node l x r) = case lookup (hash n) m of
    Just x  -> (x, m)
    Nothing -> (y, insert (hash n) y (ml <> mr))
        where
            y = x + xl + xr
            (xl, ml) = sumTreeIncMap m l
            (xr, mr) = sumTreeIncMap m r
\end{minted}

Generating a hash for every subset of the data structure for every execution is time-consuming and is unnecessary because most of the data structure stays the same. So, the Merkle Tree concept is used, which is inspired by the work of \citeauthor{miraldo2019efficient}\cite{miraldo2019efficient}. The Merkle Tree integrates the hashes with the data structure.

\section{Merkle Tree (\texttt{TreeH})}
First we introduce a new datatype \texttt{TreeH}, which contains a \texttt{Hash} for every constructor in \texttt{Tree}. Then to convert the \texttt{Tree} datatype into the \texttt{TreeH} datatype, the structure of the Tree is hashed and stored into the datatype using the \texttt{merkle} function.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
data TreeH a = LeafH Hash a
             | NodeH Hash (Leaf a) a (Leaf a)
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{haskell}
merkle :: Tree Int -> TreeH Int
merkle l@(Leaf x) = LeafH (hash l) x
merkle (Node l x r) = NodeH h l' x r'
    where
        h = hash ["Node", x, getHash l', getHash r']
        l' = merkle l
        r' = merkle r
\end{minted}

The precomputed hashes can then be used to easily create a \texttt{Map}, without computing the hashes every time the \texttt{sumTreeIncH} function is called.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
sumTreeIncH :: TreeH Int -> (Int, Map Hash Int)
sumTreeIncH (LeafH h x)     = (x, insert h x empty)
sumTreeIncH (NodeH h l x r) = (y, insert h y (ml <> mr))
    where
        y = x + xl + xr
        (xl, ml) = sumTreeInc l
        (xr, mr) = sumTreeInc r
\end{minted}

The problem with this implementation is, that when the \texttt{Tree} datatype is updated, the entire \texttt{Tree} needs to be converted into a \texttt{TreeH}, which is linear in time. This can be done more efficiently, by only updating the hashes which are impacted by the changes. Which means that only the hashes of the change and the parents need to be updated. 

The first intuition to fixing this would be using a pointer to the value that needs to be changed. But because Haskell is a functional programming language, there are no pointers. Luckily, there is a data structure which can be used to efficiently update the data structure, namely the Zipper\cite{huet1997zipper} data structure.
