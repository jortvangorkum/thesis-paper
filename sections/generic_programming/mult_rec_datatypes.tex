\subsection{Mutually recursive datatypes}
A large class of datatypes is supported by the previous section, namely \textit{regular} types. Regular types are types in which the recursion only goes into the same datatype. However, if we want to support the syntax of many programming languages, we need to support datatypes which can recurse over different datatypes, namely mutually recursive datatypes.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
data Tree a = Empty 
            | Node (a, Forest a)

data Forest a = Nil
              | Cons (Tree a) (Forest a)
\end{minted}
