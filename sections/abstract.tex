\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain incremental computation and that is used by many things
  \item Use incremental computation by reusing the structure of the data structure
  \item Implementing in Haskell is time-consuming and error-prone
  \item Explain the use of generic version of incremental computation
  \item Explain that it is faster without writing additional code given the normal function.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Motivation: making incremental computation over recursive datatypes as easy to develop as non-incremental computation
  \item Approach: -
  \item Results: -
  \item Conclusion: -
\end{itemize}
