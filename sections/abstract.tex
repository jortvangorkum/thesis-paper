When computing a result over a data type, a small change would lead to completely recomputing the result. Parts of the recomputation give the same results as the previous computation. By keeping track of the intermediate results and reusing the results when the input is the same, fewer computations have to be performed. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain incremental computation and that is used by many things
  \item Use incremental computation by reusing the structure of the data structure
  \item Implementing in Haskell is time-consuming and error-prone
  \item Explain the use of generic version of incremental computation
  \item Explain that it is faster without writing additional code given the normal function.
\end{itemize}
