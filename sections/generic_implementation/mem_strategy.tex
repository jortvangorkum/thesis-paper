Self made-up
\begin{itemize}
  \item Remove the elements that are not used in the computation.
  \item Only add elements that have a certain depth.
  \item Sort the elements based on the \textbf{amount of hits} times \textbf{the computational cost} (e.g., depth of data structure) and remove the lowest rated elements (could also be done with a probability). Additionally, reduce the amount of hits by one after every computation.
\end{itemize}

Internet
\begin{itemize}
  \item Random Replacement
  \item Queue-based policies
  \item Recency-based policies
  \item Frequency-based policies
  \item RRIP-style policies
\end{itemize}
